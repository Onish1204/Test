About Assignment:
Cucumber based BDD framework is designed with Page Factory and Junit as unit framework
(However TestNG would be better choice due to better assertions availability and
feasibility of parallel scenario execution.) For now, Basic HTML Report would be generated at reports folder
after execution with chrome Ver. 89.

Both Assignment tests are executing properly.
